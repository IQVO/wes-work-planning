-- Idempotency-Key middleware (see docs/docs/adr/0022-idempotency-key-middleware.md).
--
-- One row per Idempotency-Key value ever seen on a protected route. The
-- middleware INSERTs a bare row (status_code/response_body/response_headers
-- all NULL) inside its own transaction before calling the real handler,
-- then UPDATEs that same row with the outcome and commits — all in ONE
-- transaction shared with the use case's own aggregate write (see
-- unit_of_work.go's txKey/querierFrom/beginOrJoin, now backed by
-- internal/pgtx). A reader can therefore never observe a COMMITTED row
-- with a NULL status_code: either the row was never committed at all (the
-- inserting transaction rolled back), or it was committed only after the
-- UPDATE populated every outcome column. See idempotency.go's doc comment
-- for the full argument.
