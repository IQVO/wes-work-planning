// Package pgtx holds the ONE mechanism this service uses to bind a pgx
// transaction into a context.Context: an unexported key type plus
// WithTx/TxFrom. It exists as its own small package — sibling to, not
// nested inside, internal/adapters/inbound or internal/adapters/outbound
// — so that BOTH sides of a genuinely cross-cutting concern can bind and
// read the SAME transaction-in-context without either one importing the
// other's adapter package (which internal/architecture's fitness tests
// forbid in both directions: inbound must never depend on outbound, and
// outbound must never depend on inbound).
//
// internal/adapters/outbound/postgres (UnitOfWork.Execute, querierFrom,
// beginOrJoin — see that package's unit_of_work.go) is the primary,
// original owner of this mechanism and continues to use it for every
// repo/publisher adapter's own transaction handling.
//
// internal/adapters/inbound/http's idempotency middleware
// (RequireIdempotencyKey) is the second, new caller: it begins its OWN
// pgx transaction directly against the pgxpool.Pool it is given (no
// import of the postgres package needed for that), binds it into the
// request's context via pgtx.WithTx, and calls the wrapped handler with
// that context. When the handler's own use case later calls
// ports.UnitOfWork.Execute (backed by postgres.UnitOfWork), that
// Execute call resolves the SAME transaction via pgtx.TxFrom (through
// postgres.querierFrom/txFrom, which now delegate here) and JOINS it —
// runs its function directly on the existing transaction — instead of
// opening a second, invisible-to-each-other one. This is what makes the
// whole HTTP-request-to-response cycle (idempotency bookkeeping, the
// EnqueueWorkUnit Save(s), the outbox insert) commit or roll back
// together as one atomic unit. See idempotency.go's package doc comment
// for the fuller correctness argument and unit_of_work.go's own tests /
// the idempotency integration tests for the real, executed proof that
// the join actually happens rather than silently opening a nested
// transaction.
